# Pairwise Gaussian Loss for Convolutional Neural Networks

## Introduction

We introduce a pairwise gaussian loss (PGL) for convolutional neural networks. PGL can greatly improve the generalization ability of CNNs, so it is very suitable for general classification, feature embedding and biometrics verification. We give the 2D feature visualization on MNIST to illustrate our PGL.
