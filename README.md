# Pairwise Guassian Loss for Convolutional Neural Networks

By Yuxiang Qin, Guanjun Liu, Zhenchuan Li, Chungang Yan, Changjun Jiang

We introduce a pairwise guassian loss (PGL) for convolutional neural networks. PGL can greatly improve the generalization ability of CNNs, so it is very suitable for general classification, feature embedding and biometrics verification. We give the 2D feature visualization on MNIST to illustrate our PGL.
